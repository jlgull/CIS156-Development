Module 9 Programming Assignment

In order to receive credit for a Programming Assignment, each submission must:

    Run. No credit will be given to programs that do not run.
    Use the filename(s) specified in the What to Submit section. Do not include anything extra such as your name or chapter number.
    Include the comment block as seen in the What to Submit section, with your name, module number, and part.
    Use the looping concepts covered in this Module.

----------

Create a program called shopping_cart.py that uses a class and objects to track a couple of items for
purchase from an online store. There are three steps/sections to this program:

1. Create the ItemToPurchase class with the following specifications:

    Attributes (variable names) and their default type.
        item_name (string)
        item_price (float)
        item_quantity (int)
    Default constructor
        Initializes item_name = "none", item_price = 0, item_quantity = 0
    Method (a function in a class) name:
        print_item_cost()

2. In the main section of your code (not in the class definition):

    Instantiate the ItemToPurchase class.
    Prompt the user for two items, creating two objects of the ItemToPurchase class. The order for each is:
        Input #1: item name
        Input #2: item price
        Input #3: item quantity

3.  Finally:

    Calculate the subtotal for the two items.
    Output the two subtotals (see example).
    Calculate the total cost.
    Output the total cost.

Note that the dollar values must display two decimal places (refer to zyBooks, chapter 7.2, on floating-point precision).

Example (note that your program does not need to look, or behave, like exactly like this example -
  it is here to show you one way it might look when the program runs properly):
