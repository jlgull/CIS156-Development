"""
Create a program called product_loop.pyÂ that:

Prompts the user for a starting number (integer) greater than 1.

Prompts the user for an ending number (integer) greater than 1.

If either of the first two numbers is less than 2:
    display a message, that includes the word ERROR, to enter numbers greater than 1 and
    use a loop to continue to prompt the user for two numbers greater than 1.

Using a loop, calculate the product (the result of multiplication) of every number from the first to the second.

The output will be the product of all numbers.
