Final Project Programming Assignment

Be sure to carefully review the information in the Final Project Overview.

This assignment will automatically receive a grade of zero (0) if:

    A properly filled-out CIS156 Final Project Documentation.docx file is not submitted. √
    The program does not run in accordance with the CIS156 Final Project Documentation.docx instructions.

Required elements - each must be used

    the main program file must be named final_project.py √
        Additional module files may be named however you see fit.
        If used, make certain to submit them with final_project.py and CIS156 Final Project Documentation.docx
    a comment block in the final_project.py file that includes your name, class, and the words, "final project".  √
    at least on if statement(s) (with or without elif and else) √
    a function that accepts and uses at least one argument / parameter (This requirement cannot be met using a simple "set" method or constructor (__init__).) √
    a function with a return statement that returns a value (This requirement cannot be met using a simple "get" method.) Note: this may be the same function that accepts a parameter for the previous requirement, or it may be a different function. √
    use of a function's return value in a meaningful way √
    using a loop in a meaningful way (For example, a loop that iterates only one time before being stopped isn't meaningful. Likewise, a loop that iterates multiple times but does nothing useful/significant within the project isn't meaningful.) √
    basic exception handling using try and except √

Elective elements - at least one must be used √

    a user defined class (as covered in module 9) used in a meaningful way. The use of inheritance is not required.
    use of a list or dictionary in a meaningful way
    file reading or writing in a meaningful way

Each √ represents a graded item. There are ten.

NOTE: If all three elective elements are used, a bonus will be earned.

NOTE: You will not receive credit for completing a tutorial or modifying/adapting code from another programmer or source. Submission must be your original work, with appropriate credit/acknowledgment given to any sources you used as reference.

----------

Be sure to submit all relevant files, including the completed CIS156 Final Project Documentation.docx and, if used, all files necessary to execute your program.

=====================================

Documentation file is attached.

final, the grading script file is attached (and probably needs to be converted using dos2unix). It is meant to be placed in the PATH someplace. It is a standalone grading script. While it can't determine if something has been used in a "meaningful way", it should show enough information during its processing to determine that.
