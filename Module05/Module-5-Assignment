In order to receive credit for a Programming Assignment, each submission must:

    Run. No credit will be given to programs that do not run.
    Use the filename(s) specified in the What to Submit section. Do not include anything extra such as your name or chapter number.
    Include the comment block as seen in the What to Submit section, with your name, module number, and part.
    Use the looping concepts covered in this Module.

----------
Part A

Create a program called product_loop.py that:

    Uses a loop to:
        Input #1: Prompts the user for a starting number (integer) greater than 1.
        Input #2: Prompts the user for an ending number (integer) greater than 1.
        If either of the first two numbers is less than 2
            display a message that includes the word ERROR and that they need to enter numbers greater than 1 and
            continues to prompt the user for two numbers greater than 1 if either number is less than 1.

    Using a separate loop, calculate the product (the result of multiplication) of every number from the first to the second.
    The output will be the product of all numbers.

Examples (note that your program does not need to look, or behave, like exactly like these examples - they're here to show that all error conditions are caught and that, when there is no error condition, the result is outputted):

Part B

Create a program called valid_input.py. In a loop, prompt the user to input their age in years; keep prompting until the user inputs a number greater than zero and less than 123 (the oldest person on record lived to 122 years, 164 days). Once the user has input a valid number, output "Thank You"
